This thesis makes use of the ASSUME (Agent-Based Electricity Markets Simulation Toolbox) framework, an open-source software for simulating European electricity markets with reinforcement learning capabilities. ASSUME is developed by researchers from INATECH at the University of Freiburg, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Fraunhofer ISI, Fraunhofer IEG, and FH Aachen.
